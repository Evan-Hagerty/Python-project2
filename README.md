
2020 Python project for code louisville. 

Overview

This is a simple comparison through graphs for stocks in the S&P 500 against the S&P 500 total.
Connect to the yahoo finance API to read data in my notebook. Read from an external CSV file to make sure the stocks to compare are part
of the S&P 500. Then continue to show two graphs comparing the adjusted closing price over 20 years using plotly. 

Features 

1. Use a 3rd party API, to get stock value's over the 20 year period. 
2. Reading from a CSV and using the data in my application
3. Vizualize data in two graph's. 
4. Create a list and populate it with more than one value. Use one of the values and use it in the program. 
5. Use pandas and plotly to ingest two or more pieces of data, analyze the data and return result to a chart.
